# Python Conditions Tasks

# 1- Check if 10 is bigger than 15 or not
   x = 10
   x > 15
#--->( false )

# 2- If 10 is not bigger than 15 print x is smaller than 15
   if x > 15:
      print('x is bigger than 15')
   else:
      print('x is smaller than 15')
#---> (x is smaller than 15)

# 3- In which cases we will use all

  # we use all with more than one condition and all condition have to be right
# 4- What is the differences between all , and

   # The difference is the syntax

   
# 5- What is the differences between any , or

   # The difference is the syntax
# 6- If we need all the conditions to be true we will use ...

   # all , and
# 7- What is the differences between if , elif

   # Multiple if's means your code would go and check all the if conditions, where as in case of elif, if one if condition satisfies it would not check other conditions
# 8- What is the differences between elif else

   # if we have another condition we can use elif with this condition , and python provides you
   #with else as a default option in case no condition matches , else code will be executed
# 9- Can we use more than one elif

   # yes
# 10- Can we use more than one else

   # no
# 11- write s simple ternary operator

   x = 10
   print('x = 10') if x == 10 else print('x != 10')

# 12- in elif , python will check all the conditions no matter what ?

   # python will check the first right condition

#13- in elif we use else for ... ?

    #  else is s default option in case no condition matches, else condition will be executed

# 14- if we have this list [2,4,6,8,10] :
     #1. check to see if 4 in this list or not
     #2. check to see if 4 and 6 in this list on not
     #3. check to see if 3 or 6 in this list
     #4. check to see if 2 , 4 and 5 in this list Python Conditions Tasks
