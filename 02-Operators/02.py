python operators tasks:
1- what is the differences between =, ==
   a) =: simple Assignment operator. It assigns values from right side operands to the left side operands
        example: a = 10, the value 10 will be stored in the integer variable a
   b) ==: check if the value of two operands is equal or not, if yes then it is True
         example: if(a==10), this will check if the value stored in variable a is equal to 10. it will return True

2- what do we mean by using !=
   != : check if the value of two operands is not equal, if not then it is true
3- what is the operator precedence
   Arithmetic operators take precedence over logical operators. Python will always evaluate the arithmetic operators first (** is highest, then multiplication/division, then addition/subtraction). Next comes the relational operators. Finally, the logical operators are done last.
4- create a variable x with value of 10
   x = 10
5- Increase x value by 15 by using assignment operator
   x += 5    ---> 15
6- Divide the x value by 5 using assignment operators
   x /= 5    ---> 3.0
7- Multiply the x value by 10 using assignment operator
   x *= 10   ---> 30.0
8- Get module of x on 3 using assignment operators
   x %= 3    ---> 0.0
9- Using python print the module of 11 to 4
   print(11%4)   ---> 3
10- Print the exponent of 2,3
    print(2**3)   ---> 8
11- Divide 11 by 3 using python division
    print(11/3)   ---> 3.6666666666666665
12- Can we divide 11 by 3 and get an integer number ?
    yes, we use Floor Division to become a integer number
    example:
    print(11//3)   ---> 3
