1- x = False , x = True
2- y = 5, y = 10
3- z = 5.2, z = 3.4
4- s = 'Mohammad Ghnim', s = "Mohammad Ghnim"
5- to convert the int variablr to float we add an integer inside of the parentheses
    y = 5 --> print(float(y))
    output = 5.0
6- to convert string to int data type:
   print(int("8"))
7- list of number from 1 to 5:
   m = [1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ,5]
8- tuple from 10 to 15:
    n = (10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15)
9- convert the list to tuple:
    for example
    l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    t = tuple(l)
    print(l)
10- create a dict of three values:
    d = {1 : 'mohammad' , 2 : 'wesam' , 3 : 'zakria'}
11- yes
    It allows us to write multiple statements on the same line.
12- python is iterpreted
13-
    1- low level:
        a) the language of the computer
        b) consists of 1,0
        c) easy to be excuted
        d) hard to program
        e) can run only of one kind of computer and have to be rewritten to another
        f) like C, Assembly
     2- high level:
         easy to programm
         takes less time to be coded
         easy to be corrected
         portable (only one program can run on any pc)
         like java, c# and python
